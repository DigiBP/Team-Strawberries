## Introduction
The selection of the supplier might be a quite tought process to go through. That said a strategic approach of choosing the right supplier is important. 

Our project team is dedicted to help the SMEs to chose the right supplier efficienlty and without investing too much time in the due dilligence process. 

Our project,

## Background
Our project's primary objective is to transform and enhance the supplier selection process by leveraging digitalization and automation technologies. By integrating these cutting-edge solutions, we aim to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the decision-making process for choosing suppliers. To achieve this, we plan to develop sophisticated decision models that incorporate clearly defined rules and criteria, ensuring a consistent and transparent evaluation process.

Additionally, we will create Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that facilitate seamless integration with existing systems and enable a user-friendly platform for effortless operation. This platform will empower stakeholders to access essential information, streamline workflows, and make informed decisions in a timely manner. The combination of advanced decision models and an intuitive digital platform will not only simplify the supplier selection process but also promote a more collaborative and data-driven approach to strategic procurement management.

## Description of the Workflow-Steps
The process model begins with identifying potential suppliers through market research, consulting stakeholders, reviewing industry publications, and creating a list of potential suppliers. If enough suppliers are identified, the process moves to the pre-qualification stage. In this stage, suppliers are evaluated based on criteria such as company characteristics, product quality, financial stability, geographical location, and sustainability practices. Initial screening of suppliers is performed using these criteria, and if there are enough pre-qualified suppliers, the process proceeds to soliciting information from suppliers. This involves developing and distributing a Request for Information (RFI) or Request for Proposal (RFP), and reviewing responses. Based on the satisfactory nature of the responses, the process either continues to the evaluation stage or returns to earlier steps.

The evaluation stage consists of developing a weighted scoring system, scoring and ranking suppliers based on their RFI/RFP responses, and conducting site visits or audits if necessary. If top-ranked suppliers are suitable, the process moves to negotiating and setting contract terms, which includes developing negotiation strategies, negotiating with top-ranked suppliers, finalizing contract terms, and signing contracts. Once negotiations are successful, the process enters the monitoring and review stage. This involves establishing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), monitoring supplier performance, conducting periodic reviews, providing feedback, and identifying improvement opportunities. If the supplier meets performance expectations, the relationship continues; otherwise, contract terms are revisited or alternative suppliers are considered.
